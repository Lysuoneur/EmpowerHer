## Task 5: Style on HTML

**Inline Styles**

Inline styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute. This allows for quick and specific styling of individual elements.

**Example:**

```html
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 36px;">This is a heading</h1>
```

**Pros:**

- Quick and easy to implement.
- Can be used for one-off or temporary styles.

**Cons:**

- Makes HTML code less readable and maintainable.
- Difficult to manage styles for multiple elements.
- Not suitable for large-scale projects.

**External Stylesheets**

External stylesheets are separate `.css` files that are linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This promotes better organization, reusability, and maintainability.

**Example:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

**Pros:**

- Improves code organization and readability.
- Easier to manage and maintain styles.
- Allows for code reuse across multiple pages.
- Suitable for large-scale projects.

**Cons:**

- Requires additional setup and linking.
- May introduce a slight delay in page loading.

**In general, it's recommended to use external stylesheets for most web projects, especially as the project grows in complexity.** Inline styles should be used sparingly for specific cases or temporary styling needs.
