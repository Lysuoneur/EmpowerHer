## Task 10: Box Model

**CSS Box Model**

The CSS box model represents each HTML element as a box, composed of four main components:

1.  **Content:** The actual content of the element.
2.  **Padding:** The space between the content and the border.
3.  **Border:** The outline surrounding the content and padding.
4.  **Margin:** The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.

**Understanding the Box Model**

The box model affects the layout and spacing of elements on a web page. By understanding and manipulating its components, you can control the size, shape, and position of elements.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Box Model</title>
    <style>
        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 20px;
            margin: 20px;
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">This is a box.</div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `.box` element has a width of 200px, a height of 100px, a black border of 1 pixel, a padding of 20px on all sides, a margin of 20px around the element, and a light blue background color.

**Visual Representation:**

**Effect of Changing Components:**

- **Padding:** Increases the space between the content and the border, making the element appear larger without affecting its layout.
- **Border:** Adds a border around the element, increasing its overall size and creating a visual separation.
- **Margin:** Creates space between the element and other elements, affecting the overall layout and spacing.

By understanding and manipulating the box model, you can effectively control the layout and appearance of elements on your web page.
