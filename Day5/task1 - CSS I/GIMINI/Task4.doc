## Task 4: How to Debug CSS

**Common CSS Issues:**

* **Typographical Errors:** Incorrect spelling or syntax can lead to unexpected results.
* **Selector Specificity Conflicts:** Multiple selectors targeting the same element can cause conflicting styles.
* **Inheritance Problems:** Styles inherited from parent elements might not be as intended.
* **Browser Compatibility Issues:** Different browsers may render CSS differently.
* **Layout Problems:** Incorrect use of display properties, floats, or positioning can cause elements to be misplaced.

**Debugging Techniques:**

1.  **Browser Developer Tools:**
    - **Inspect Elements:** Right-click on an element and select "Inspect" to view its applied styles, including CSS rules, computed styles, and layout information.
    - **Console:** Use the console to log values, check for errors, or execute JavaScript commands.
    - **Style Editor:** Modify styles in real-time and see the immediate effects on the element.
2.  **CSS Linter:**
    - Use a linter to automatically detect syntax errors and potential issues in your CSS code.
3.  **Commenting Out Code:** Temporarily comment out sections of your CSS to isolate the problem.
4.  **Using a Reset Stylesheet:** Normalize browser defaults to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

**Example:**

**Problem:** An element is not displaying as expected.

**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Inspect the element:** Check if the element is being targeted by the correct selector.
2.  **Check for conflicting styles:** Look for other selectors that might be affecting the element.
3.  **Verify inheritance:** Ensure that inherited styles are not causing issues.
4.  **Test in different browsers:** Check if the problem is browser-specific.

**Example CSS Issue:**

```css
.my-element {
    display: none;
    /* Typo: should be "block" */
}
```

**Solution:** Correct the typo to `display: block;` to make the element visible.

By following these steps and utilizing browser developer tools, you can effectively debug CSS issues and create well-styled web pages.
