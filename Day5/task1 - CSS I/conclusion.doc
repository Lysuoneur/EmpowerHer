**From basic styling principles to more advanced techniques like Flexbox and CSS variables, each aspect contributes to building visually appealing and well-structured websites.**


"CSS Fundamentals: We started with the basics, learning how CSS defines the presentation of HTML documents, enabling changes like background color, text color, and font size with ease.

Styling Approaches: We examined different methods for applying styles:

Inline CSS for direct, one-time changes;
Internal CSS for controlling styles within a single document;
External CSS for reusable, project-wide stylesheets, which is the most scalable method.
CSS Selectors: We explored how various selectors (element, class, ID, attribute, and pseudo-classes) target specific HTML elements to style content dynamically.

Debugging CSS: Understanding how to troubleshoot and fix common CSS issues using browser developer tools ensures faster development cycles and better UI results.

Styling Text and Fonts: CSS provides powerful tools to control typography, allowing customization of font types, sizes, weights, and alignments, which enhances readability and design aesthetics.

Web Fonts and Favicons: We saw how to integrate custom fonts using online services like Google Fonts and how to add favicons to improve user experience and brand identity.

Advanced Layout Techniques:

The CSS Box Model explains how elements are structured with content, padding, borders, and margins.
Flexbox simplifies responsive design, enabling developers to create flexible, adaptable layouts that adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes.
CSS Variables: Custom properties (CSS variables) were introduced to show how consistency can be maintained in stylesheets and how easy it is to update designs by altering values in one place."
