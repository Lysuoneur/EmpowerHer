### Tables vs. `<div>` Elements for Layout in CSS

    In web development, both tables and `<div>` elements can be used to organize and present content, but they serve different purposes and are appropriate in different contexts.
    
    #### Tables
    
    - **Purpose**: Tables are designed specifically for displaying tabular data. They should be used when the content is structured in rows and columns, such as data reports, pricing plans, or schedules.
    - **Semantic Meaning**: Using `<table>` elements adds semantic meaning to the content, making it clearer for screen readers and improving accessibility.
    - **Styling**: While tables can be styled with CSS, they come with inherent layout behaviors that may be less flexible compared to `<div>` elements.
    
    #### `<div>` Elements
    
    - **Purpose**: The `<div>` element is a generic container used to group content for styling or scripting. Itâ€™s more flexible and can be used to create complex layouts.
    - **Semantic Meaning**: `<div>` elements do not convey any inherent meaning about the content, making them less suitable for tabular data.
    - **Styling**: `<div>` elements are more adaptable to modern CSS layout techniques (like Flexbox and Grid) and can be styled extensively.
    
    ### Example: Using Tables and `<div>` Elements
    
    Here's an HTML document that demonstrates the use of both tables and `<div>` elements for layout, with accompanying CSS styles.
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Tables and DIV Elements</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                margin: 20px;
                background-color: #f4f4f4;
            }
    
            h1 {
                text-align: center;
                color: #333;
            }
    
            /* Styles for the table */
            table {
                width: 100%;
                border-collapse: collapse;
                margin-bottom: 20px;
            }
    
            th, td {
                border: 1px solid #ddd;
                padding: 10px;
                text-align: center;
            }
    
            th {
                background-color: #4CAF50;
                color: white;
            }
    
            /* Styles for the div container */
            .info-container {
                display: flex;
                justify-content: space-around;
                margin-bottom: 20px;
            }
    
            .info-box {
                background-color: #fff;
                border: 1px solid #ddd;
                border-radius: 5px;
                padding: 20px;
                width: 30%;
                box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Using Tables and DIVs for Layout</h1>

    ```
    
    ### Explanation of the Code
    
    1. **HTML Structure**:
       - The document includes a heading, a `<table>` for displaying tabular data, and a container of `<div>` elements for additional content.
    
    2. **Table**:
       - The `<table>` contains a `<caption>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>`, which structure the data into rows and columns.
       - Each table cell has borders, padding, and background colors for better readability.
    
    3. **DIV Elements**:
       - The `.info-container` class uses Flexbox to arrange the three `.info-box` elements horizontally and space them evenly.
       - Each `.info-box` has a white background, padding, and a shadow to distinguish them visually from the background.
    
    ### When to Use Tables vs. `<div>` Elements
    
    - **Use Tables**:
      - When displaying structured data that is best represented in a grid format (e.g., reports, schedules).
      - When semantic meaning and accessibility are priorities, as tables convey the relationship of the data.
    
    - **Use `<div>` Elements**:
      - For layout purposes when the content does not naturally fit into a table structure.
      - When needing flexibility for responsive design, such as creating sections of a webpage that can easily adapt to different screen sizes and layouts.
    
    ### Conclusion
    
    Understanding the differences between tables and `<div>` elements is crucial for effective web design. Tables should be reserved for tabular data, while `<div>` elements offer more flexibility and adaptability for layout purposes. This example illustrates how both can be effectively utilized in an HTML document to present content in a clear and organized manner.
